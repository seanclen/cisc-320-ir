RUN INSTRUCTIONS

Enable for the compiler to compile the project correctly, we must make the linker
aware of all of the files in the directory, be default this doesn't happen

To fix this we wrote a custom runner to do this for us to save time while testing
and debugging

To run the program please use the 'C++ (use this)' runner. This can be found by
selecting Run > Run With > C++ (use this)
